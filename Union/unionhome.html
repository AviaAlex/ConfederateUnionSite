      Our Anaconda Plan
  </h1>
  The Anaconda Plan is a obscure plan that is not well known by the Confederacy, but, we are planning to create a naval and military blockade, to attempt to squeeze the south until they fall due to supply shortages. <br/>
  We are planning to execute the Anaconda plan soon, but by the way the Confederacy was acting about it, we are sure that they have their own plans in mind. <br/>
  When the Anaconda plan does execute, we do expect our military blockade to siege the south.

Make sure you do not drink contaminated water, and only eat food raw if you know it is safe. If you are not sure, ask a general.
