      Our Anaconda Plan
  </h1>
  The Anaconda Plan is a obscure plan that is not well known by the Confederacy, but, we are planning to create a naval and military blockade, to attempt to squeeze the south until they fall due to supply shortages. <br/>
  We are planning to execute the Anaconda plan soon, but by the way the Confederacy was acting about it, we are sure that they have their own plans in mind. <br/>
  When the Anaconda plan does execute, we do expect our military blockade to siege the south.

    How to stay healthy during the war
</h1>
To stay healthy during wartime, it is <span style="font-weight:bold">important</span> that you take precautions, or you will die from illness. <br/>
One way you can be healthy is staying away, at least 3 feet away from other people who are sick, and make sure you have sufficient clothing at all times, or you will get sick, either from hypothermia, or from stroke. <br/>
Make sure you do not drink contaminated water, and only eat food raw if you know it is safe. If you are not sure, ask a general.

    What to expect when fighting in the war

When fighting in the war, you have to expect the worst, especially when you are in a a battle, such as Antietam. <br/>
You will also get dirty during the war, so it is dire that you at least try to stay as clean as possible, especially when you are in those long 3-day battle situations. <br/>
