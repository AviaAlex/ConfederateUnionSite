      Our Battle Plan
  </h1>
  The plan we are using is to get Great Britain to help us, since we supply a lot of cotton to them, but hopes are lowering, mainly because lately, Britain hasn't been accepting our help requests. <br/>
  Despite having low hopes of getting help, we will still send out help requests to other countries and ask them for help.

    How to stay healthy during the war
</h1>
To stay healthy during wartime, it is <span style="font-weight:bold">important</span> that you stay healthy, or you will die from illness. <br/>
One way you can be healthy is staying away, at least 3 feet away from other people who are sick, and make sure you have sufficient clothing at all times, or you will get sick, either from hypothermia, or from stroke. <br/>
Make sure you do not drink contaminated water, and only eat food raw if you know it is safe. If you are not sure, ask a general, such as our southern gentleman, Robert E. Lee.

    What to expect when fighting in the war. 
</h1>
When fighting in the war, you have to expect the worst, especially when you are in a a battle, such as Antietam. <br/>
You will also get dirty during the war, so it is dire that you at least try to stay as clean as possible, especially when you are in those long 3-day battle situations. <br/>
